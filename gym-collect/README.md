# Description
2D environment where the agent has to collect coins to get a reward.

I oriented myself at this article:
https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q-learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/
Here q-learning is used to solve the taxi-gym.

# Installation

First we have to install the gym-collect as a python module.
`pip3 install -e gym-collect`

# Run
In the `agents` folder run `python3 reinforcer.py`
